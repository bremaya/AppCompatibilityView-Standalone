# AppCompatibilityView Standalone

View / modify compatibility settings of Windows applications stored in AppCompatFlags Registry key

AppCompatibilityView (https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/app_compatibility_view.html) is a simple tool that displays the list of all programs that run with different compatibility settings, stored in the Registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers keys.
It also allows you to easily modify or delete the compatibility settings of multiple applications at once.

This is a personal project, and I'm not related with Nir Sofer (https://www.nirsoft.net/) or PortableApps (https://portableapps.com).
Only unpack and enjoy (unpack in PortableApps folder to integrate with him).

This is packed with AppCompatibilityView v1.07.
